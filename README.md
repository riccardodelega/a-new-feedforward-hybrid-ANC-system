# Implementation and comparison of ANC systems
Conventional broadband noise control systems may work ineffectively if the noise to be removed contains both wideband and broadband components. Xiao and Wang's 2011 paper "A New Feedforward Hybrid Active Noise Control System" proposes a new hybrid system to tackle this issue. Bismor's 2014 paper "Comments on “A New Feedforward Hybrid ANC System”" refutes some of the statements made in Xiao and Wang's paper.

The two MATLAB scripts reproduce the simulations in the papers and can be used to verify the claims of the authors.
